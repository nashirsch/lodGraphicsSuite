For Project 6 we will start by finishing all the features mentioned
in Project 5 and fixing up any remaining bugs. In terms of embellishments
we are going to try to add rain, vegetation, and a fancier skybox. We'd
also like to explore an "On-The-Ground" mode which would place the camera
close to the terrain, and any movements would translate the camera position
"along" the terrain, as if a user was walking along the ground. 
If time permits we would also add mouse controls to govern the
camera's direction vector.
